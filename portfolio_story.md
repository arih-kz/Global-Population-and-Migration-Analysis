# Portfolio Project Story: Global Population and Migration Analysis

## The Problem
Migration is often discussed as a social or political issue, but it is deeply connected to economic conditions and demographic changes. This project investigates whether people move primarily due to population pressure or in search of better economic opportunities.

## The Approach
Using three separate datasets covering population, net migration, and GDP per capita, this project applies data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and correlation analysis to understand how these variables interact over time across regions.

The analysis does not treat datasets in isolation. Instead, it combines them to reveal patterns that are not visible when looking at a single indicator.

## Key Questions Explored
- Does high population growth lead to higher migration?
- Do economically stronger regions attract more people?
- Is GDP per capita related to migration behavior?

## What the Analysis Revealed
The results showed that population growth alone does not explain migration patterns. Instead, regions with stronger economic indicators tend to retain or attract population, while regions with weaker economies experience migration loss.

A correlation analysis between GDP per capita and net migration supported the idea that economic opportunity plays a significant role in migration decisions.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning and preprocessing of multiple datasets
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data merging and regional comparison
- Correlation analysis and interpretation
- Communicating insights through data visualization and markdown explanations

## Why This Project Matters
This project demonstrates the ability to work with real-world, multi-source data and extract meaningful insights that explain human behavior using data. It reflects practical data analyst skills such as critical thinking, data preparation, and insight communication.

## Outcome
This project strengthened the understanding that data analysis is not just about code, but about asking the right questions and clearly explaining the story hidden in the data.
