# Global Population, Migration, and GDP Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores how population growth, net migration, and GDP per capita interact across global regions over time. By combining demographic and economic data, the analysis aims to understand the key drivers behind migration patterns and regional population changes.

The project focuses on identifying whether migration trends are more strongly influenced by population pressure or by economic opportunity.

## Objective
To analyze the relationship between population growth, migration patterns, and GDP per capita across regions and understand how economic conditions influence migration behavior.

## Datasets Used
- **Population Dataset** – Historical population data across regions and years
- **Migration Dataset** – Net migration values showing inflow and outflow of people
- **GDP per Capita Dataset** – Economic indicator representing regional prosperity

These datasets were cleaned and analyzed to discover meaningful relationships and trends.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning and preparation for multiple datasets
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Regional comparison of demographic and economic indicators
- Correlation analysis between GDP per capita and net migration
- Interpretation of migration behavior using economic context

## Key Findings
- Population growth alone does not explain migration trends
- Regions with higher GDP per capita tend to experience lower outward migration
- Economic opportunity appears to be a stronger driver of migration than demographic size
- Combining demographic and economic indicators provides deeper insights than analyzing them separately

## Conclusion
The analysis highlights how economic conditions significantly influence migration patterns. Regions offering better economic opportunities tend to retain or attract population, while weaker economies often experience migration loss.

This project demonstrates how data analysis can be used to understand real-world socio-economic behavior using multiple datasets.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter
3. Run cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis
